Taking Tallulah to Central Park was a must over marathon weekend. However for me, in that moment as I reflected on my 2019 NYC marathon race I felt the importance that day held for my life. I discovered the real me during that run, I fell hopelessly in love, I believed I could do things I had previously doubted my ability to do, I showed up and completed the job at hand that day with one of the biggest smiles possible. Those 26.2 miles in 2019 changed my life both personally and professionally. As I looked at Tallulah and Austin in the moment as we approached the finish straight, tears flowed. Tears of happiness and pride for myself, and for my little family and where we are three years down the line."

However my first signs of pregnancy were different this time, my  @ouraring  actually noticed ahead of me, showing high resting heart rate and elevated body temperature at night. When it reminded my period should have arrived was when I was prompted to take a test. Having technology measuring our body\u2019s output is often solely associated with fitness and performance, and prior to pregnancy that was my main focus. During my pregnancy journey, however, I leant on my Oura Ring more than I could have imagined, from logging how I was sleeping to understanding how the effects of my training was changing. Learning about my body is a passion and I\u2019m very grateful to part of the Oura family, continuing my education and I am so excited to see how my body reacts to coming back to training\u2026when it\u2019s ready!    #withoura   #ourapartner"

I asked her why we work out and she said to get stronger \ud83e\udd79 and it was that exact moment I realized that I\u2019m doing what I feel like I was meant to do. All the times I doubted, compared and disliked myself were necessary in order for me to find my confidence, my energy and outlook on myself, others and LIFE. And fitness was the catapult. My goal is to inspire women (of all ages) to embrace who they are & feel fabulous about themselves so they can experience the joy I felt once I stopped trying to be perfect and starting being ME! We lift weights to get stronger (we know how heavy those Trader Joe\u2019s bags can be),build our confidence and set our energy so we can change the narrative for future generations. Working out isn\u2019t to look a certain way it\u2019s to feel a certain way. So we can go out into the world and be the best version of ourselves not just for us but for others\u2026 for little girls like Charlie. On that note, don\u2019t forget to \u2728BYOE\u2600\ufe0fI love you all. Grateful for  @onepeloton"

In a country with multiple eating disorder epidemics, the only thing this does is continue to entertain the narrative that leads to harmful habits in girls, adolescents & women.  Bad Bunny\u2019s Dancers (athletes), made a video on Tik Tok casually highlighting this, not realizing the conversations it would spark, and i\u2019m grateful for that. I\u2019ve personally talking a lot more with friends about our experiences amidst the  #heroinchic  stunt. It was personally very triggering for someone who in the past struggles with their body image.  When I went to argentina I visited a couple stores with an average-sized family member looking for PJ\u2019s and we could not find any that fit.  @anybodyargentina  has been working diligently to pass a sizing law in Argentina that went through but is not being implemented.

This is the distance between her home and her friend Elissa Baskind  #luekemiawarrior  in Leeds UK, as she goes through treatment. They met on the Leaderboard- after noticing that they often took the same rides and rode at the same pace. They connected over the interwebs and became dear friends. And today, a whole crew is riding together, with hands on each others backs in support. So here is what I hope you take away from this-  You never know what the person before you, beside you, behind you, is carrying. Everyone at some point could use a hand on their back. If we can carry this mindful awareness into our everydayness, we may find more moments of peace in our lives, and we may create more peace in the lives of others. And in this- we create community. THIS is what the Peloton I ride in is about. THIS is what turns the leaderboard into the Community Board.  THIS is what the company I came to 8 years ago is about. So if you\u2019re looking for a place to ride away from the noise of the world, we got you. EDIT: PS Elissa is also riding on three week old double hip replacement today. #whatifyoucan . #iamicaniwillido   #onepeloton   #handsonyourback   #luekemia   #healing   #cycling   #miles   #support   #powerzone"

We are going to talk about how the pandemic has impacted our inner monologue and how we can manage that self-talk for good. . And, we are going to PLAY WITH CRAYONS. . Looking forward  to seeing you all tomorrow. PS My favorite color is Midnight Teal.  Is that a crayon color? Maybe it should be \ud83d\udd8d PPS Fun Fact: our wedding photographer snapped the second pic in our engagement shoot in front of the Crayola Experience. I had no idea until we saw the photos that he included the crayon guy.  I thought that was playful.  And brilliant.

These beautiful humans made my Sunday and then some. So much love for my  #pelofam . \u2063 \u2063 P.S. Back to back Saturday/Sunday hugs with  @tune2tunde  ?  YES, PLEASE !"

To feel where your feet should be: 1\ufe0f\u20e3 Start in a tall kneeling position  2\ufe0f\u20e3 Step forward into half-kneeling and mark where both feet are placed on the floor 3\ufe0f\u20e3 Stand up into a split squat (the static position of a lunge in terms of foot placement) and see how that feels to move in and out of. (In the video I need to bring the back foot in a little as it didn\u2019t feel quite comfortable - the half kneeling position gives you an idea of starting point, but readjust as you need with feel). It then takes practise to feel what feels comfortable for you.  The dowel rod is a great way to practise the position and get some repetition in, so you can familiarise yourself with how the movement feels.  Over time, you will naturally fall into your foot position without having to think about it, but allow yourself the practise if needed.  Other useful points are: \u25aa\ufe0fstance width, is roughly hip-width apart (this should ideally happen due to you starting in the half kneeling position)  \u25aa\ufe0fin forward lunges, drive back off the front heel, not the toes.  \u25aa\ufe0fwarm up well, ahead of lunges, they demand a lot of the body.  In terms of complexity: split squats < reverse lunge < forward lunge  Take your time building competence in each one, there\u2019s no rush, and remember, more complex, does not mean better, it just means more complex (jump lunges etc. add in more complexity again)  Play around with all of these positions - we all have different limb lengths and bodies.  Explore and familiarise yourself with the movement of yours.  If lunges come up in a workout, do the variation that meets your body where it\u2019s at.  Do you have a favourite?"

The reality is, if you\u2019re pushing hard every session, you\u2019re not actually pushing hard at all, your body doesn\u2019t work like that.  If the tank is empty and you\u2019re still pushing, you\u2019re working in a deficit, and of course that will feel like hard work.  It\u2019s important that you know the difference between working hard on empty, and moving at an intensity that you can only get to when you have recuperated smartly - both are uncomfortable. Only one will move you forward.  Seeing what your body can do is incredible!  That capacity for everyone is different, we all have different goals/intentions.  For some it\u2019s moving at a low intensity often; for others it\u2019s maxing out and seeing what your body can do once or twice per week as part of a wider  programme.  One is not better than the other, but if the latter is yours, recovery is your best friend so that you can really go to that place.  Happy Friday loves \u270c\ud83c\udffd"

Just to be clear, if you are sick, take a rest, your recovery is important and the workout can wait.  If however you feel a little under the weather, or not quite 100% and would still like to move, here are some options.  1. Complete rest - again, if you are sick, get better.  2. Reduce the intensity at which you\u2019re working by reducing any of the following- \u25aa\ufe0ftime \u25aa\ufe0fdistance \u25aa\ufe0fspeed \u25aa\ufe0fweight \u25aa\ufe0freps \u25aa\ufe0fsets and, or increasing rest periods.  3.

This also goes for if you\u2019re short on time or your day doesn\u2019t quite go to plan.  You had hoped for a 30 minute workout, but now you only have 20.  You have twenty minutes to still move, or fifteen or ten.  Something is always better than nothing, unless it\u2019s much needed rest; and in that case, nothing is a full mood \u270c\ud83c\udffd"

Good things take time, require a ton of dedication & determination, consistency and patience. Whether it\u2019s hand, balancing, mobility, yoga, meditation, philosophy, self growth or whatever you\u2019re working towards.  One of my favourite Sutras from The Yoga Sutras of Patanjali is 1.14;  Practice becomes firming grounded when well attended to for a long time, without break, and in all earnestness.  So if it doesn\u2019t come across as \u2018easy\u2019, keep working at it. Regress it. Break it down. Make it easier. Create a solid foundation of strength and flexibility and build from there.  How long does it take? Well, the real question is, how much time are you willing to put into it?  2 years training 1 or 2 times a day is different than 2 years training once or twice a week.  Then you have to ask how important is said thing\u2026 how much time are you willing to dedicate towards it.  And last thing, find people who inspire you. Don\u2019t be intimated, be inspired and let them help drive you \u2728 Sooooo\u2026 give it a go. Break it down. Share and tag me! \ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffc #mobility   #pistolsquat   #dragonsquat"

I know the aftermath means more mental clarity, I tend to be emotionally lighter, and feel physically accomplished. I also remind myself that it\u2019s good to do hard things. Humans are strong as hell and sometimes we forget it.  But my favourite part is when you first get in and EVERY SINGLE part of your body and mind is screaming GET OUT!! And rather than giving in to the stress response, you tame it and teach it to be calm in a stressful situation\u2026.and within a number of seconds, you can calm yourself down, \u2018chill\u2019 \u2744\ufe0f, and maybe even have a laugh.

The desserts came and they were delicious; and I kind of went to town on them. Like I ate A LOT of each one. I couldn\u2019t stop myself; and then afterwards I couldn\u2019t stop beating myself up about it. The next morning I woke up and made myself run on the treadmill in the hotel room. I vowed not to eat that day and was literally crying over eating too much the night before. Instead of thinking about how much I enjoyed a night with my family. I am so sad that I did that to myself. I had an unhealthy relationship with food at that time. I think it was probably because I had an unhealthy relationship with myself and my body. I viewed things in extremes; and \u201call or nothing\u201c too often. I am only sharing this because maybe you can relate. It\u2019s hard to not beat ourselves up. It\u2019s hard to believe in ourselves and allow ourselves to feel centered and comfortable with who we are. When we lose touch with our inner guide, we can go to extremes, or find things to obsess about (food being one of them), or swallow our feelings.  I am really happy I am in a place where I can enjoy what I want to without worrying about it. I am more mindful and present with myself and less anxious about what I do or eat or say. I just wake up feeling pretty cozy in my body, mind and spirit. I am also more aware when I feel the need to fixate on things or find myself obsessing or spiraling into unhealthy thoughts or patterns. I definitely credit much of this to my \ud83e\uddd8\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2640\ufe0f & meditation practice.  It\u2019s a life long love affair with the person in the mirror. Not always easy but definitely always worth it. So if you woke up today with any guilty feelings or negative voices in your head; I ask you to take a deep breath, go for a walk, be really gentle with yourself. No matter your age, shape, height, you name it; life can be hard. It can also be so magical when we stop hating on ourselves and embrace ourselves with pure love. Drop a \u2764\ufe0f below and let\u2019s help each other feel this way too!!!"

(Believe me I\u2019m trying to be on mine less and less!) Our heads are meant to be aligned with our spine.  Put your index finger on your chin and gently press your head back. It honestly feels so good!! It opens up our shoulders, aligns our heads with our hearts, and keeps us looking UP and and not down. What an awesome analogy for life!  Check in with yourself throughout the day - when you\u2019re botht on and off the mat. Gently press your chin back into alignment and see how great it makes you feel! Tag a friend who could use this reminder for self care as well!  Happy Tuesday!"

Feel the engagement of the entire pelvic floor on an exhalation. Think of the back and front side lifting (my fav pilates teacher used to say \u201ccan of beans and double latte\u201d). This is helpful for our posture, the strength of our glutes, and for rehabbing the pelvic floor and diastasis. Throughout the day, do a check to see if you are tucking under too often.

Bird dog & Dead bug both target the transverse abdominals (think inner corset) which stabilizes our spine and pelvis. Before we move our limbs, we want to feel strong in our core.  I love these as warm ups before any activity; as well as for anyone with diastasis or back issues. Make sure to maintain a neutral pelvis when performing these. Breathe deeply and aim for 4-6 reps 3 sets on a daily basis!  What\u2019s your fav core move?"

I believe the way we can discover more about our potential is through pursuing difficult physical efforts. When I first tried to climb a rope with one arm I didn\u2019t think I could, when I made it to the top I knew I had exceeded my own expectation on what I thought I was capable of.

The word itself is derived from vita or \u201clife\u201d. Vitality was the theme of the corporate wellness event with Cigna last week and it got me thinking about this beautiful relationship between our bodies and minds and how we contribute to their development.  When we choose to pursue challenging workouts we\u2019re strengthening our mental vitality just as much as the physical and the body knows it. I\u2019ve never met someone who regrets having done a workout at the end of it - even if during it all you wanted to do was stop. We prove to our body and mind that pushing through the struggle/resistance is VITAL and on the other side is always exposed potential and gratitude. It\u2019s what reminds our body and mind that it\u2019s far more capable than it knows.  #vitality"

It\u2019s been raining outside aaall freakin\u2019 day long, which is why C & N are both soaked, and why Nico is a little pissed. Her socks and shoes are wet, her pants are full of mud, and she mixed up the train times earlier on (which is a whole other story - let\u2019s just say it didn\u2019t lift her mood).  Not my favorite day ever, little Nico thinks.  C & N wiggle their butts into the car. Nico to Eduardo (Uber driver): This weather sucks.  Eduardo: Ooh why? It\u2019s just a little rain. Nico: It just makes everything harder.  Eduardo: But it\u2019s just rain. It comes and goes.  Nico: True. Could be worse.  Eduardo: Yeah, it could be cold outside. But it\u2019s not. It\u2019s just rain.  You\u2019re headed out of the city? Weekend trip?  Nico: Yeah, off to the beach and out into nature.  Eduardo: Aah come on - that\u2019s wonderful. And you\u2019re complaining about the rain..! [Silence] Nico: You are a wise man, Eduardo. A very wise man. Nico and Charlie wobble out of the car. Smiles on their faces (yes, Charlie\u2019s too, obv).  I hope y\u2019all bump into your own Eduardo, just when you need it. #perspective  \ud83d\udc9c"

Consistency requires a long-term commitment. It builds confidence and trust in yourself because every time you honor a promise to yourself, the more likely you are to achieve your goals. I always say little by little amounts to a lot and while it might not feel like you're moving the needle much, over time you will see progress. If you\u2019re struggling with motivation, I invite you to think about your WHY instead. WHY are you choosing to move your body day after day? The reason has to be bigger than yourself or any external gaze.  PS -  I\u2019m doing a familiar challenge again next month that has a lot to do with this messaging. Any guesses? \u2b07\ufe0f Official announcement coming soon. \ud83d\udc40"

I wrote because I had something to say. Little did I realize, that I was writing to share a part of me that people needed to see the most. It\u2019s been 7 months since Speak was published and this week it\u2019s officially announced one of  @amazon \u2019s Best Books of 2022 in Business and Leadership, and  @audible \u2019s Best of 2022 in the Well-Being category. Thank you for taking my words and cherishing them as your own. Thank you for reading and being kind with my deepest thoughts. Thank you for shining the lessons back at me and reminding me to surrender, live in my power, lead with empathy, be authentic, and (understand) my knowledge.  Thank you to everyone who helped Speak come to life and who continue to support me as I write my next chapter. Thank you to my team,  @hilaryliftin  and everyone at  @avidreaderpress  &  @simonandschuster"

For me \u201cshowing up\u201d or \u201cputting in the work\u201d isn\u2019t always about a PR or being the best. It\u2019s believing that even in the struggle bus moments I will find a way to get to the end. Leaving me with a lesson, new coping skills, a new strategy, and/or reflection point.  The honesty I receive from that machine and the boat is unfiltered. It doesn\u2019t care about my feelings, I just receive the truth. The biggest lesson I learned on the water that I bring on land is centering yourself. There are moments where the water is so choppy you\u2019re like \u201cwhy did I do this?\u201d  \u201cI can\u2019t do this?\u201d  \u201cOh shoot how do I get out of this?\u201d  You have a choice to stop but then what? Or you can keep going, building momentum, and forging past the rough patch. And after awhile you adapt to the choppy water. It no longer is a barrier. So when it\u2019s flat water you\u2019re smooth sailing.  I don\u2019t always have the perfect stroke and I am not always the fastest person on the water but I still keep showing up and putting in the work not for anyone else but me. I\u2019m excited to share more of the lessons I\u2019ve learned on the water in the studio with you all.  I can\u2019t wait to master the choppy water with you \ud83e\udef6\ud83c\udffe  Scenic coming soon\u2026 #missionbaysandiego"
